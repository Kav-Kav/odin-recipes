          <h2>Ingredients</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>24 baby red potatoes</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded smoked Gouda cheese</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon onion powder</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>½ pound bacon, cut into thirds </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Steps</h2>
          <ol>
              <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
              <li>Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a skillet over medium; cook and stir garlic until fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>
              <li>Place potatoes in a microwave-safe bowl; add 1 tablespoon olive oil and toss to coat. Heat in the microwave until potatoes are tender enough to easily poke with a fork, about 6 minutes. Cool until easily handled.</li>
              <li>Slice potatoes in half and scoop filling into a bowl. Set potato skins aside.</li>
              <li>Mash garlic, potato filling, Gouda cheese, onion powder, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Fill potato skins with potato mixture and sandwich the potato halves together. Wrap a bacon slice around each filled potato and place on a baking sheet.</li>
              <li>Bake in the preheated oven until bacon is cooked and crisp, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
          </ol>
